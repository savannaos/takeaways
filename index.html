                  <p>Jac reminded me things about myself I had forgotten and continued to for the rest of the year.
                  Jac is incredibly observant, empathetic, offers well-timed advice and perspectives,
                  and knows when to boost me and when to challenge me. She will forever be my rock.
                  My coworker Emily brokedown the friendship barrier and invited me to her birthday. I'm glad she did because she has love oozing out of her in a way that always leaves me feeling happy and assured.
                  Our twice-weekly checkins and animal memes helped me through this year.

                  <p>I went skiing for my birthday.
                  Rushing down the mountain and feeling so many endorphins,
                  I realized I had been depressed.
                  I first confided in my partner who helped me understand it was nothing I had done wrong and instilled confidence in me to get better.
		The next step was getting off the birth control that was putting me in a hormonal flux.
                  I then committed to doing things that felt good.
                  So I taught a virtual dance class for kiddos. I journaled. I walked.
                  This all helped my depression and I thankfully haven't felt this way since.
                  But with covid rampent, my emotional state started to favor anxiety instead.</p>

	  	  <p>My mom and sister got covid and have since recovered. This made me think a lot about loss. Time with people felt ephemeral. I have deep respect for anyone who cares for the health of their loved ones on the regular. It's emotionally exhausting to be worried and unable to do anything about it. Amidst this, I got a promotion. I was already grateful for still having a job and my employeer's approach to covid strengthed my respect for them. A couple friends and I started virtual yoga. Thank you for sharing your quarantine experiences with me: you have been just as dynamic as this year has been. Thank you for giving me a reason to roll out my yoga mat, smile, and unwind together. </p>

                  <p>My partner and I biked the Cape Cod trail.
                  It was a needed escape and we were fortunate to go on a day hardly anyone was around.
                  We ate seafood facing the windy ocean and it was a calm peace I needed.

                  <p> I hosted a Society of Women Engineer's professional development event with over 200 virtual attendees. I started an iOS app development project at work, which made me realize that I prefer more visual work like this.</p>
                  
                  <p>
                  I saw a therapist for the first time. There were a lot of things I was beating myself up about and she helped me recognize my patterns and ways to help myself.

                  <p>I did a variety of new things to break up the monotony. Of my favorite was when my sister and I painted a flower bed and then I harvested snap peas and arugula from it. Seeing things grow is peaceful and fulfilling. </p>

                  <p>I experienced burnout for the first time.
                  It left me apathetic and existential.
                  My partner, who I had also been apathetic and distant towards,
                  encouraged me to
                  understand myself through explaining my grief and turmoil to others.
                  So I did. Thank you for everyone who felt with me. Especially Amanda and Zhanna who endulged me in hours long walk and talks.
                  Thank you for my partner who understood me, even when I didn't.
                  I got through it.
                  I scheduled a break, kept with therapy, and finished strong in class.
                  My partner and I celebrated by making homegrown pesto and veggie pizzas.</p>

                  <p>
                  The highlight of August was my solo camping trip.
                  Dudley and I camped in the Lake region for a week.
                  I relaxed: cozied up with a book and my ukulele.
                  The non relaxing parts make me appreciate things I take for granted:
                  having food readily available, having shelter that isn't threatened by the rain and winds.
                  Having protection against whatever it was that Dudley was growling at 3AM...
                  (it's fine; we're fine)
                  I enjoyed a hike up Rattlesnake Mountain
                  and then Jase joined the last day for canoeing and another two mountains.</p>

                  <p>I safely visited Colorado with my sister and built a deck base with my dad! I appreciated bonding with family through time outdoors. Estefany was going through similar life changes and confiding in her was cathartic and empowering. At work, we wrapped up major changes to the iOS app and closed out that project. I applied to an internal opening that I ultimately didn't get but helped me stay motivated and connected to my work goals.</p>

                  I made progress in my classes, using my deadline anxiety to fuel me to start sooner.
                  I shook things up by throwing Dudley a "party", found rollerblades at Savers, turned my apt's garage into my own derby xD
                  , had several calls with friends and family, celebrated a year with my partner, and did yoga in the park.

                  <p>I went to Arizona for Katrina's wedding.
                  I don't know her journey to getting where she is now, but I'm so proud of her.
                  She found a connection who's important to her and a love for her job.
                  I couldn't have asked for a better travel buddy: we were cautious but had fun.
                  Jessi's curiousity and humor kept me grounded and playful.

                  <p>If this seems like a lot: it's because it is. I spent a good chunk of the year feeling stressed out, existential, or restless. But I also spent it feeling reflective and hopeful.
                  </p>
                  <p> I learned some valuable lessons in communication and not taking things personally. I've learned that jealousy and comparison rarely serve me. I'm practicing reframing, affect labeling, and showing compassion to myself. Most importantly I've tried to not deny myself whatever it is I'm feeling. Through that I can recognize the cause and address assumptions, recognize my achievements that negate those assumptions. Understand what I'm in control of and accept what I'm not. Make a plan for whatever I need to change.
